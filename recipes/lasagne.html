                <li>1.5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 cups milk</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded cheese</li>
                <li>freshly ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>12 spinach lasagne noodles</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Metod</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onions and saute for 3 minutes.<br>
                 Add the peppers and saute for 2 minutes. Add the zucchini and saute 3 minutes <br>
                 before adding the tomatoes, tomato paste, garlic and oregano, basil, thyme, salt and pepper. <br>
                 Cover the saucepan and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes (the longer the better as long as the sauce is not sticky.)</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>While the sauce cooks, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan. Add the flour into the butter, stir vigorously for 2 minutes.<br>
                     Gradually add the milk, stirring until the sauce thickens. Stir in the cheese, reserving as much as you will want to sprinkle on top of the lasagna.<br>
                     Stir the cheese into the flour and butter mixture until it has melted completely. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Soak the lasagna noodles in water for 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Cover the bottom of the prepared dish with some of the tomato sauce, followed by a layer of the lasagna sheet, and the cheese sauce.<br>
                 Continue layering these ingredients ending with a layer of cheese sauce. Sprinkle the final layer of cheese sauce with nutmeg, salt, pepper, <br>
                 and the reserved cheese.</li>
                 <li>Bake the lasagna 40 to 50 minutes, until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
                    </ol>
